# brushscript
Gimp script to convert directory full of images to gimp brushes

This was originally written by Emily Smirle.
I fixed the "convert to RGB only if needed"
Stopped it from flattening (untransparenting) the brushes
I also added the spacing and name settings in the save function to be the base filename of the source file.
