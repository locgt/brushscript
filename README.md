# brushscript
Gimp script to convert directory full of images to gimp brushes

This was originally written by Emily Smirle (http://registry.gimp.org/node/24606).

I fixed it up and added some features:
*Use RGB not Greyscale for more of a "stamp" brush
*convert to RGB only if needed"
*Stop from flattening (untransparenting) the brushes
*added the spacing and brush name (to base filename) by switching to the gbr-save function.
